# Algorithms

C# implementations of some of the algorithms and data structures found in "Algorithms, 4th Edition" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

The purpose of this project is for me to learn more about C# and Algorithms. Nothing here is fit for use in any serious setting.

###### Currently implemented

- Collections
  - Bag
  - Queue
  - Stack
  - PriorityQueue
  
- Searching
  - Binary Search
  
Unit Tests are included for each of the implemented algorithms and data structures.
